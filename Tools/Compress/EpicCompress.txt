Epic Compress 1.0 - By Dirtbag, based on orginal code by Stifu
- Part of the Project L Tool Set

Epic Compress takes the compression algorithm from Epic Edit's code and turns it into a command line based tool for SMK assist editing.
The aim of this was to replace Luna Compress with a more flexible tool and using the better compression ratio from Epic Edit's Codec.
This tool was named Epic Compress to as homage to the excellent Epic Edit and to pay respects to the origins of the codec that this tool uses at its core.

Epic Edit is an amazing Mario Kart Editor by Stifu. and can be found here https://epicedit.stifu.fr/

- Extract raw data from file between start and end offsets
- Insert into raw data file at offset

- Wait feature - "Press any key"
- Overwrite feature to prevent a file that already exists being overwritten


Usage:

EpicCompress.exe <Input File> <Output File> -compress or -decompress or -insert -double -wait -overwrite -offset {value in hex}

Files to use, both must be specified:

        <Input File>: The file you want to extract data from
        <Output File>: The file you want to import data into, can be an existing file or a new file

Mode of use pick one of the following:

        -compress: Compress the data
        -decompress: Decompress the data
        -insert: Insert the data as is, without compression or decompression

Optional commands

        -double: Double compress or decompress the data
        -wait: Will wait for a key press before exiting
        -overwrite: Use to overwrite the destination file if that file already exists
        -offset <value in hex>: The offset you want to compress or inert to or decompress from.
         When not used in conjunction with -compress will assume you are compressing to a new file

Examples:

        EpicCompress.exe smk.smc bc3.layout -decompress -double -offset 214EE
        EpicCompress.exe bc3.layout smk.smc -compress -double -offset 214EE
        EpicCompress.exe AIZones smk.smc -Insert -offset 1FF9B
        EpicCompress.exe smk.smc mole.gfx -decompress -offset 5D6 -wait
